# [Course Wrap](http://www.coursewrap.io/#/)

The absolute best place to find high quality and free OpenCourseWare content from the world's leading colleges and universities! Course Wrap uses a sophisticated web scraping algorithm to compile a database of OpenCourseWare content, and organizes that content into a stylish, simple and user friendly webapp that makes finding courses on whatever you're looking for a breeze. 

This repository holds all the code for the front end of the website, which interacts with our backend api. The front end is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Material-UI](https://material-ui-next.com/), with a special emphasis on compact design and usability.
